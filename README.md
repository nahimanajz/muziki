# Muziki
Muziki is a web application that allows users to search for artist's information and artist's albums related songs yet  authorized users can save into favorites buckets to review after

### Running tests
This project is tested with (Pest)[https://pestphp.com/] and [dusk] [https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/dusk]

  *Test with pest*

 *Test with Dusk*
 ``` php artisan dusk ```
 if dusk test don't run  head over to ``env file`` and set `APP_URL` to ``APP_URL=http://localhost:8000``


 ## Testing pages with laravel dusk
 - Install `composer require laravel/dusk:* --ignore-platform-req=ext-zip`

 N.b: If you encounter ``Class "ZipArchive" not found ``
 1. You need to have chrome browser 122 or higher installed
 2. In terminal type php --ini, secondly open php.ini file and add `extension=zip` save and install by ` composer require laravel/dusk:* `
 3. Running test will truncate db thus you are encouraged to create new user in order to test functionality on browser

## feedback
1. You need to implement the Google login.
2. Use pagination, eg: FavoriteAlbumController

`$favoriteArtists = FavoriteAlbum:::where("userId", Auth::id())->with("tracks")->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->get()`
Change to
`$favoriteArtists = FavoriteAlbum:::where("userId", Auth::id())->with("tracks")->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->paginate();`âœ…


3. Use policies to handle authorisation
```
 public function show(FavoriteAlbum $favoriteAlbum):Response
  {
	    $this->authorize('show', $favoriteAlbum);
  {
```
4. Move validation to a separate validation/request class. You can read more about it here

```
$validated = $request->validate([
      "name" => "required|string",
      "listeners" => "required",
      "mbid" => "nullable",
      "streamable" => "required",
      "url" => "url:http,https|required",
]);
```
